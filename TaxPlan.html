                        <li><p>Reduce taxes across-the-board, especially for working and middle-income Americans who will receive a massive tax reduction.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Ensure the rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs or undermines our ability to compete.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Eliminate special interest loopholes, make our business tax rate more competitive to keep jobs in America, create new opportunities and revitalize our economy.</p></li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><p>The Trump Plan will collapse the current seven tax brackets to three brackets. The rates and breakpoints are as shown below. Low-income Americans will have an effective income tax rate of 0. The tax brackets are similar to those in the House GOP tax blueprint.</p></li>
                        <li><p>The Trump Plan will retain the existing capital gains rate structure (maximum rate of 20 percent) with tax brackets shown above. Carried interest will be taxed as ordinary income.</p></li>
                        <li><p>The 3.8 percent Obamacare tax on investment income will be repealed, as will the alternative minimum tax.</p></li>
                        <li><p>The Trump Plan will increase the standard deduction for joint filers to $30,000, from $12,600, and the standard deduction for single filers will be $15,000. The personal exemptions will be eliminated as will the head-of-household filing status.</p></li>
                        <li><p>In addition, the Trump Plan will cap itemized deductions at $200,000 for Married-Joint filers or $100,000 for Single filers.</p></li>
